## Run directories are here
RUNDIRS=/home/jovyan/efs/CmCt/RUNS

## Completed runs for retrieval.  FTPLOCAL is where we put them on the
## local file system.  DLLIST is the user's download file list.
# FTPLOCAL=/WWW/secure/pub/cmct               # secure site
# DLLIST=https://ggsghpcc.sgt-inc.com/cmct/download/filelist.php

## Older versions of above for reference.  FTPURL is where individual
## download packages would appear on the Web, BUT Craig says it's a
## security hole, so we're not using it anymore.
# FTPLOCAL=/home/ftp/pub/cmct               # original insecure site
# FTPLOCAL=/home/cmct/tmp-ftp/pub/cmct      # Temporary for testing
# FTPURL=https://ggsghpcc.sgt-inc.com/pub/cmct     # secure site

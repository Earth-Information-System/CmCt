## NAME:cmct_launch.ksh
##
## PURPOSE: Launch script for CMCT.  Gets information about a new
## submission, creates a run directory, populates it with the downloaded
## model file and .json configuration files, and launches GRACE_Master.sh.
##
## The run directory will have 3 subdirectories, MODELS, WORK, and OUT.
## Model files go in MODELS.  The work is done in WORK.  Output is packaged
## into OUT before being copied to the retrieval directory.
##
## REQUIRES:  The "jq" command-line JSON parser.
##
## PARAMETERS:
##    ${1}:  Path to JSON run configuration file
##
## TBD: Error checking is minimal!!!

## AUTHOR: Jeff Guerber, SigmaSpace/GSFC615, Mar. 2016
## 2016-04-21 JRG: Latest.
## 2016-04-22 JRG: Tar and gzip the results, copy to "ftp" area, send user
##    email.  Bug fixes.
## 2016-04-25 JRG: Added error trapping.
## 2016-04-26 JRG: chmod g+w on created directories.  Bug fixes.
## 2016-04-27 JRG: Verbose flag -v on mailx calls. Fix BCC.
## 2016-04-27 JRG: -r cmct@sgt-inc.com on mailx calls.
## 2016-05-02 JRG: Added security code from Craig.
## 2016-06-02 CJ?: Updated .htaccess content.
## 2016-06-07 JRG: Copy result files to a staging dir and tar that.  Added
##    the new results directory list URL to the user email. (Direct
##    retrieval seems to still work too.)
## 2016-06-07 JRG: Lori doesn't want direct link ($URL) in the email.
##    Added file name and run title to email.
## 2016-06-10 JRG: At Tom's request, put the direct link back in the email.
## 2016-06-10 JRG: Turns out the direct link is vulnerable to SQL
##    injection attacks!  So it's back out, again.
## 2016-07-11 JRG: Minor change in the email text.
## 2017-08-30 EGS: Changed it to the Gracetool.
